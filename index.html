                    GWe nuclear power plant in Bangladesh. 
                    The nuclear power plant is being constructed at 
                    Rooppur (Ruppur), adjoining Paksey, in the Ishwardi 
                    Upazila of Pabna District, on the bank of the river Padma, 
                    87 miles (140 km) west of Dhaka, in the northwest of the 
                    country. It will be the country's first nuclear power 
                    plant, and the first of two units are expected to go into
                    operation in 2023. The VVER-1200/523 Nuclear 
                    reactor and critical infrastructure are being built by the
                    Russian Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation.
                    "Non-critical" infrastructure is being built by Banglades
                    hi and Indian construction companies such as the MAX Group
                    of Bangladesh and the Hindustan Construction Company of
                    India.

                <h3>Planing</h3>
                <p class="about__description">After the independence of Bangladesh, the Government of 
                    Bangladesh started discussion with the Soviet Union in 1974, 
                    but no agreement was reached. In 1976–77, the French company 
                    Sofratom conducted a feasibility study and found the project 
                    at Rooppur feasible. In 1980, a 125 MW nuclear power plant project 
                    was approved. However, this effort also did not materialize. 
                    In the 1987-88 period, another feasibility study was conducted 
                    and the decision was taken to construct a 300 to 500 MW nuclear
                        power plant. In 1998, steps were taken to construct a 600 MW 
                    power plant. The nuclear action plan was approved in 2000.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2005, Bangladesh signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with 
                    China. In 2007, the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission (BAEC) 
                    proposed two 500 MW nuclear reactors for Rooppur by 2015. 
                    In 2008, China offered funding for the project. Instead, 
                    the Bangladesh government started discussion with the Russian
                        government a year later and on 13 February the two governments
                        signed a memorandum of understanding. Rosatom said they would
                        start construction by 2013.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2011, International Atomic Energy Agency conducted IAEA 
                    Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review (INIR) mission in 
                    Bangladesh. Later on, IAEA approved a technical assistance 
                    project for the Rooppur nuclear power plant. In 2013 a group
                        of Bangladeshi scientists and the global diaspora voiced 
                    profound concern over the safety and economic viability of 
                    the plant. Several separate issues were raised, from the 
                    unsuitability of the site to the obsolescence of the 
                    VVER-1000 model proposed, questionable financing arrangements 
                    and a lack of agreement with Russia over nuclear waste disposal.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2015 the proposal was delayed by a year. Rosatom offered a 
                    two VVER-1200 reactor power plant, increasing output to 2.4 GWe.
                        By December 2015 The Daily Star reported that the estimated 
                    cost of the plant had climbed to US$13 billion, from statements
                        of around US$4 billion made earlier in the same year.
                    German based Transparency International expressed concern on 
                    28 December 2015 about the safety of the proposed plant.

                <h3>Construction</h3>
                <p class="about__description">
                    In 2016 ground preparation work commenced. The $12.65 billion 
                    contract is 90% funded by a loan from the Russian government. 
                    The two units generating 2.4 GWe are planned to be operational
                    in 2023 and 2024. Rosatom will operate the units for the first
                    year before handing over to Bangladeshi operators. Russia will
                    supply the nuclear fuel and take back spent nuclear fuel.
                    <br><br>
                    On 4 November 2017, Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission received,
                    from Bangladesh Atomic Energy Regulatory Authority, the design 
                    and construction license of Unit 1, paving the way for the nuclear
                    island first concrete pour.
                    The nuclear reactor and critical infrastructure are being built by
                    Russian companies. Atomenergomash is the engineering division of 
                    Russia's state nuclear corporation, Rosatom. This company is the 
                    supplier of all the equipment for the reactor compartment of Rooppur
                    Nuclear Power Plant and a significant part of the equipment for the
                    machine room. As of November 2017, more than 2,200 employees are
                    at work at the site, including 450 Russian specialists. In the main 
                    construction period, the total number of employees will reach 12,500, 
                    including 2,500 specialists from Russia. Over 70 tenders have been
                    issued for ‘non-critical’ works where Bangladeshi and Indian construction
                    companies can participate. The Hindustan Construction Company is in a join
                    t venture with the Bangladesh-based MAX Group, where the Bangladeshi company
                    holds a 60 present share and the Indian company holds a 40 percent share.
                    <br><br>
                    On 14 July 2018, the first concrete was poured for Unit 2. The following
                    month, Rosatom began installing a 200-tonne core catcher as the first large
                    piece of equipment in the reactor building of Rooppur 1, describing it as "a
                    unique protection system".

                <h3>Safety</h3>
                <p class="about__description">
                    VVER-1200/523 is one of the latest Generation III+ nuclear reactor. 
                    Design feature of the nuclear reactor is layered safety barriers preventing
                    escape of radioactive material. <b>The reactor has five layers:</b> <br><br>

                    <b> Fuel pellets:</b> Radioactive elements are retained within the crystal structure of the fuel pellets. <br><br>
                    <b> Fuel rods:</b>  The zircaloy tubes provide a further barrier resistant to heat and high pressure.<br><br>
                    <b>Reactor shell:</b> a massive steel shell encases the whole fuel assembly hermetically.<br><br>
                    <b>Core catcher:</b> A core catcher is a device provided to catch the molten core material 
                    (corium) of a nuclear reactor in case of a nuclear meltdown and prevent it from escaping
                    the containment building.<br><br>

                    <b>Reactor building:</b> A concrete containment building is the last line of defence. 
                    It prevents escape of radiation. It also protects from external damages.
                    The nuclear part of the plant is housed in a single building acting as 
                    containment and missile shield. Besides the reactor and steam generators 
                    this includes an improved refueling machine, and the computerized reactor 
                    control systems. Likewise protected in the same building are the emergency 
                    systems, including an emergency core cooling system, emergency backup diesel
                    power supply, and backup feed water supply. A passive heat removal system had
                    been added to the VVER-1200. The system is based on a cooling system and water
                    tanks built on top of the containment dome. The passive systems handle all
                    safety functions for 24 hours, and core safety for 72 hours.
                    <br><br>
                    Other new safety systems include aircraft crash protection, hydrogen recombiners, 
                    and a core catcher to contain the molten reactor core in the event of a severe accident.

                    Bangladesh's development strategy sees the country becoming a middle-income nation by 2021,
                    in large part by emphasis on its science and technology sector to drive economic growth. 
                    The ministry of science and technology (MoST) estimated in 2014 that US$6.2 billion will 
                    be needed in the next decade to achieve the goals of Vision 2021. The Science and Technology
                    Act 2010 is helping to boost this, and MoST is now allocating over $150 million per year 
                    to nuclear technology development as gas reserves become depleted. The power plant will also
                    promote the local economy of Rooppur, Pabna.
